# DiskImageTool
View and manipulate floppy disk images

This is a personal project of mine.  I decided to make the source code available in case anyone finds it useful, but at no time should it be considered production quality.

What does DiskImageTool do?

- It allows you to view and perform simple repairs on IBM PC formatted floppy disk images.
- You can easily copy files and folders in and out of images by dragging and dropping.
- Convert between multiple image formats
- Create new disk images
- File properties editor
- Boot sector editor
- File Allocation Table (FAT) editor
- Full featured Hex editor.  Focus on individual regions of the disk or view and edit the entire disk.
- Text file viewer
- Raw track viewer
- Easily repair a modified boot sector OEM Name using a built in database of suggestions.
- Clean up modifications made by Windows to the boot sector and directory entries with one click.
- Open hundreds of images at one time and use powerful filters to narrow down your search to the ones that need your attention.
- Read and Write floppy disks using a Greaseweazle (https://decromancer.ca/greaseweazle/)
- Import raw Flux Sets using either Greaseweazle Tools (https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle) or KryoFlux Host Software (https://kryoflux.com/)
- Built in Database to identify known disk images (Mostly games at this time)
