# DiskImageTool
View and manipulate floppy disk images

This is a personal project of mine.  I decided to make the source code available in case anyone finds it useful, but at no time should it be considered production quality.

What does DiskImageTool do?

1. It allows you to view and perform simple repairs on IBM PC formatted floppy disk images.
2. You can easily copy files and folders in and out of images by dragging and dropping.
3. Convert between multiple image formats
4. Create new disk images
5. File properties editor
6. Boot sector editor
7. File Allocation Table (FAT) editor
8. Full featured Hex editor.  Focus on individual regions of the disk or view and edit the entire disk.
9. Text file viewer
10. Raw track viewer
11. Easily repair a modified boot sector OEM Name using a built in database of suggestions.
12. Clean up modifications made by Windows to the boot sector and directory entries with one click.
13. Open hundreds of images at one time and use powerful filters to narrow down your search to the ones that need your attention.

DiskImageTool suports the following image formats:
1. Basic Sector Images (.ima, .img, .vfd, .flp, .160, .180, .320, .360, .720, .120, .144, .288, .dmf, .xdf)
2. WinImage Compressed Disk Image (.imz)
3. ImageDisk Sector Image (.imd)

7. HxC HFE v1 Image (.hfe)
8. HxC MFM Image (.mfm)
9. Transcopy Image (.tc)

DiskImageTool can also open the above image types from within Zip files.

Suggestions for new features are welcome.
